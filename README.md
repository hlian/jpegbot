## Hello

`/jpgto kittens` and the bot will post the URL to the current channel! Beware of NSFW words -- I'll fix that soon. You'll need an incoming token and a custom command. Runs on port 83.

## What is this, really?

A demo app for [`Network.Linklater`](https://github.com/hlian/linklater), a library I wrote! It lets you write Slack bots very easily. Please check it out, whenever you have free time.
